# Product Context

## Why KGDreamInvest Exists

### Problem Statement
Traditional algorithmic trading systems suffer from several key limitations:
- **Black Box Decision Making**: Most systems provide no explanation for trading decisions
- **Static Relationships**: Market relationships are hardcoded rather than dynamically learned
- **Single-Agent Thinking**: Decisions come from one perspective, missing nuanced analysis
- **High Barrier to Entry**: Real trading systems require significant capital and risk

### Market Gap
There's a lack of educational tools that demonstrate:
- How AI/LLM systems can make financial decisions
- How knowledge graphs can model market relationships
- How multi-agent systems can provide diverse perspectives
- How autonomous trading systems actually work under the hood

## What Problems We Solve

### 1. **Explainable AI in Finance**
- Every trading decision comes with plain-English explanations
- Multi-agent committee shows different analytical perspectives
- Knowledge graph relationships are transparent and queryable
- Decision confidence scores provide uncertainty quantification

### 2. **Dynamic Market Understanding**
- Knowledge graph edges automatically update based on observed correlations
- Relationships evolve as market conditions change
- System learns from continuous market observation
- Adapts to regime changes without manual reconfiguration

### 3. **Safe Learning Environment**
- Paper trading eliminates financial risk
- Configurable guard rails prevent runaway behavior
- Real market data provides authentic learning experience
- Mistakes have no real-world consequences

### 4. **Multi-Agent Perspective**
- **Macro Agent**: Analyzes bellwethers and regime signals
- **Technical Agent**: Focuses on momentum and mean reversion
- **Risk Agent**: Manages exposure and cash buffers
- **Allocator Agent**: Synthesizes inputs into final decisions
